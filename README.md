PID Fan Controller with PIC18F4550

Fan angle inclination controller with PIC18F4550, this project implements a UI that allows the user to change the distance between the hall effect sensor and the magnet attached to a blend in front of a Fan motor handled with the PWM module of the Pic, and teh data recived from the sensor is handled by the ADC module.
